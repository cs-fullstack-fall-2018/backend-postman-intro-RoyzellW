# backend-postman-backend-intro

You don't have to clone this repo. Follow the directions below:

1) Post three times to put three new enteries in your database. Use the same username.
2) Send a GET request and take a screenshot of the new entries.
3) Go to mlab and take a picture of the entries in your database.
4) Upload the two screenshots to this repo.

// From Kenn: Only one of the three requests can be seen in the second picture and the picture of mlab shows old data. Make sure you are posting three separate times to get credit.
